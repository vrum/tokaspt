The Once Known as SmallPT is a cheap editable realtime derivation of http://kevinbeason.com/smallpt/

By way of the marketing department, some outrageously insignificant numbers:
on a QuadroÂ® FX 5800, on the default scene at default resolution and configuration, 768x512x(2x2)x118fps = 185.6M 4-bounces rays are traced per second (alternatively, a maximum of 742.4M bounces are generated).

Requires CUDA 2.1 to compile and run.

Short introduction:
  * arrows, pg-up/down to move, `[ctrl]` faster, `[shift]` slower.
  * mouse 1: center camera, `[alt]` spawn sphere.
  * mouse 2: drag, move camera, `[shift]` other plane.
  * mouse 3: picking, `[ctrl]` resize, `[alt]` move, `[alt+shift]` move other plane.
  * 'u': toggle full 3D bloat.
  * 'z': reset the accumulation buffer.
  * most actions are about a selection, and are templated from the clipboard.
  * ctrl-c/ctrl-v: copy/paste, `[shift]` paste at camera.
  * 'backspace': deselect; '+'/'-': cycles selection; 'del': delete selection, 'home': look at selection.
  * F5/F9: load/save.
  * F2: global operations.
  * 'p' to toggle the top left panel, 's' to toggle the right one (which is about the selection).
